digit_cnn presents a 17 layer custom network for the task

digit_cnn_pretrained_tuned uses VGG16 with initialised weightings and fine tuning to acheive its result

digit_cnn_untrained does the same as above, minus the fine tuning and initialised weights

to load any of the models, drag a .h5 downloaded from the link given in the report to the digit_CNN folder, then open the desired program file and modify the model.load_weights() call.
